# Tari Improvement Proposals (TIPs)

Welcome to the Tari Improvement Proposals repository. This repository contains a structured list of RFCs (Request for Comments) for improving the Tari blockchain.

## What are TIPs?

TIPs are design documents providing information to the Tari community, describing new features, improvements, or processes for Tari. Each TIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

## TIP Structure

Each TIP is stored as a markdown file in the `tips` directory with a unique number. The filename format is:

```
tips/TIP-XXXX.md
```

Where `XXXX` is a zero-padded four-digit number (e.g., `TIP-0001.md`, `TIP-0002.md`).

## TIP Template

All TIPs should follow the standard template located at `TIP-template.md`. The template includes the following sections:

- **Title**: A short descriptive title
- **Status**: Draft, Active, Accepted, Rejected, or Superseded
- **Author(s)**: The people who created the TIP
- **Created**: Date the TIP was created
- **Abstract**: A brief description of the proposal
- **Motivation**: Why this change is needed
- **Specification**: Technical details of the proposal
- **Rationale**: Design decisions and alternatives considered
- **Implementation**: Implementation notes and references

## Creating a New TIP

1. Copy the `TIP-template.md` file
2. Name your TIP with the next available number (e.g., `TIP-0003.md`)
3. Fill in all sections of the template
4. Submit a pull request
5. Update the table below with your TIP
