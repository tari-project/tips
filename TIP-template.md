# TIP-XXXX: [Title]

```
TIP Number: XXXX
Title: [Short descriptive title]
Status: Draft
Author(s): [Your Name] <your.email@example.com>
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Abstract

A brief (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

Clearly explain why the existing Tari blockchain needs this improvement. What problem does it solve? Who benefits from this change?

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.

### Technical Details

Include:
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Protocol changes
- API changes
- Network message formats
- Consensus changes
- Any other relevant technical details

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

## Backwards Compatibility

All TIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The TIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for TIPs that affect consensus changes. Other TIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation

The implementation must be completed before any TIP is given status "Active", but it need not be completed before the TIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus before writing code.
