```
TIP Number: 0001
Title: TIP Process and Guidelines
Status: Draft
Author(s): Tari Community

## Abstract

This TIP describes the Tari Improvement Proposal (TIP) process and guidelines. It outlines how TIPs should be structured, the workflow for submitting and reviewing proposals, and the various statuses a TIP can have throughout its lifecycle.

## Motivation

As the Tari blockchain ecosystem grows, there needs to be a clear, standardized process for proposing, discussing, and implementing improvements. A formal TIP process ensures that:

1. All stakeholders can participate in the evolution of Tari
2. Proposals are well-documented and thoroughly reviewed
3. The community has visibility into upcoming changes
4. Technical decisions are made transparently
5. Historical context is preserved for future reference

## Specification

### TIP Format

Each TIP is a markdown document stored in the `tips/` directory with the filename format `TIP-XXXX.md`, where XXXX is a zero-padded four-digit number.

### TIP Statuses

- **Draft**: The initial status of a new TIP. The proposal is being actively developed and discussed.
- **Accepted**: The TIP has been reviewed and accepted by the community and core developers.
- **Active**: The TIP has been implemented and is currently in use.
- **Rejected**: The TIP has been rejected and will not be implemented.
- **Superseded**: The TIP has been replaced by a newer proposal.

### TIP Workflow

1. **Idea**: Discuss your idea with the community first
2. **Draft**: Create a TIP using the template and submit a pull request
3. **Review**: The community reviews and provides feedback
4. **Revision**: Address feedback and update the TIP
5. **Acceptance**: Core developers accept or reject the TIP
6. **Implementation**: Implement the accepted TIP
7. **Activation**: The TIP becomes active when deployed

### Required Sections

All TIPs must include:
- Header with metadata (number, title, status, author, date)
- Abstract
- Motivation
- Specification
- Rationale
- Backwards Compatibility (if applicable)
- Implementation
- References

## Backwards Compatibility

This TIP establishes the initial process and has no backwards compatibility concerns. Future changes to the TIP process itself should be proposed as new TIPs.

## Test Cases

Not applicable for this process-oriented TIP.

## Implementation

The implementation consists of:
1. This repository structure
2. The TIP template (`TIP-template.md`)
3. Documentation in the README
4. This TIP itself as a reference
