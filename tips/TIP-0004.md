## Abstract

This TIP describes the Tari Hidden Bulletin Board Protocol (THBBP), a pattern for creating censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving bulletin boards using Tari's encrypted messaging capabilities. By leveraging Tari's one-sided transactions and encrypted transaction metadata, users can post messages to a private bulletin board while maintaining anonymity and ensuring message integrity. The bulletin board operator controls a Tari address and publishes its view key, allowing anyone to read messages sent to that address while message senders remain pseudonymous. This enables use cases such as whistleblowing platforms, anonymous forums, decentralized social media, public announcements, and community coordination without requiring protocol changes to Tari.

## Motivation

Applications can use the THBBP to create public message boards where:
- Message senders remain anonymous or pseudonymous
- Messages cannot be censored by third parties once posted
- Message authenticity can be cryptographically verified
- The bulletin board is publicly readable but privately writable
- All communication is recorded immutably on the blockchain

The bulletin board operator creates a Tari wallet and publishes the public address and view key. Users send transactions to this address with encrypted messages in the transaction metadata. Anyone with the view key can scan the blockchain and read all posted messages, but message senders maintain privacy through Tari's one-sided transaction model.

Use cases include:

| Use case | Possible implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Whistleblowing Platform | Anonymous tips and evidence submission to investigative organizations with cryptographic proof of submission time |
| Decentralized Forums | Community discussions without centralized server control or censorship |
| Public Announcements | Timestamped, immutable announcements from organizations with verifiable authenticity |
| Dead Drop Communication | Secure one-way communication channels for sensitive coordination |
| Community Coordination | Protest coordination, emergency alerts, or public notices in censorship-prone environments |
| Research Data Publication | Anonymous publication of scientific data or research findings with timestamp proof |

## Specification

No changes are required to implement this on Tari, but users who wish to implement a bulletin board would need to:

1. Create a private view key and spend key (usually from creating a new wallet with a seed phrase)
2. Create a Tari address (A) from the view key and spend key
3. Keep the spend key secret to prevent unauthorized spending
4. Publish the Tari address (A) and the view key publicly or to a selected audience. [Tari Hidden Address Protocol](TIP-0003.md) may also be used here.
5. Users post messages by sending transactions to address A with message content in encrypted metadata
6. Anyone can use the view key to scan the blockchain and retrieve all messages

### Technical Details

**Message Structure:**
- Messages are embedded in transaction metadata/encrypted notes
- Each transaction represents one message or bulletin board post
- Message format should include:
  - Content (text, JSON, or other structured data)
  - Optional: Message type identifier
  - Optional: Reply-to transaction ID for threading
  - Optional: Signature for verifiable identity (if desired)

**Reading Messages:**
- Use the published view key to scan blockchain transactions to address A
- Decrypt and extract message metadata from each transaction
- Sort by block height/timestamp for chronological ordering
- Build conversation threads using reply-to references

**Message Integrity:**
- Transaction hash provides unique message identifier
- Block inclusion provides timestamp proof
- Blockchain immutability ensures messages cannot be altered or deleted
- Optional digital signatures allow verifiable authorship

### Technical Details

**Security Considerations:**
- View key publication allows anyone to read all messages
- Sender privacy depends on Tari's transaction privacy features
- Blockchain storage costs apply (transaction fees)
- Message size limited by transaction metadata capacity
- No built-in moderation or spam prevention (economic cost via fees provides some deterrent)

## Rationale

This pattern leverages existing Tari privacy features to create censorship-resistant communication channels without requiring protocol modifications. The separation of view keys and spend keys allows public readability while maintaining sender privacy and operator control.

**Design Decisions:**
- **Why use view keys instead of fully public addresses?** View keys allow selective disclosure and better privacy controls
- **Why blockchain-based?** Provides immutability, censorship resistance, and timestamp proof
- **Why not build a separate protocol?** Leverages existing Tari infrastructure and security model

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- Fully encrypted bulletin boards (requires key distribution complexity)
- Public plaintext addresses (reduces privacy)
- Off-chain storage with blockchain anchors (reduces immutability guarantees)

## Backwards Compatibility

Not applicable - this is a usage pattern, not a protocol change.

## Test Cases

Not applicable - this is a usage pattern, not a protocol change.

## Implementation

Implementation would typically include:

1. **Bulletin Board Service:**
   - Blockchain scanning service using view key
   - Message parsing and indexing
   - API or web interface for reading messages

2. **Client Applications:**
   - User interface for composing messages
   - Transaction creation with metadata encoding
   - Message threading and conversation views

3. **Reference Implementation:**
   - Example service code for scanning and displaying messages
   - Client libraries for posting messages
   - Documentation for message format standards
