# TIP-0002: Example Blockchain Improvement

```
TIP Number: 0002
Title: Example Blockchain Improvement
Status: Draft
Author(s): Tari Community
Created: 2025-11-04
```

## Abstract

This is an example TIP demonstrating the structure and format that all Tari Improvement Proposals should follow. It proposes a hypothetical improvement to the Tari blockchain to serve as a reference for future TIP authors.

## Motivation

This example TIP serves several purposes:

1. Provides a concrete example of a well-formatted TIP
2. Demonstrates how to structure technical proposals
3. Shows the level of detail expected in each section
4. Helps new contributors understand the TIP process

While this TIP doesn't propose an actual change to Tari, it illustrates how a real proposal should be documented.

## Specification

This section would contain the detailed technical specification of the proposed change. For example, if proposing a new consensus mechanism, it would include:

### Algorithm Overview

A high-level description of the proposed algorithm or feature.

### Data Structures

```rust
// Example data structure
pub struct ExampleBlock {
    pub header: BlockHeader,
    pub transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    pub metadata: BlockMetadata,
}
```

### Protocol Changes

Detailed description of any changes to network protocols, message formats, or communication patterns.

### Consensus Rules

If the proposal affects consensus:
- New validation rules
- Modified block production
- Updated transaction validation
- Network upgrade requirements

### API Changes

Any changes to:
- RPC interfaces
- REST APIs
- Client libraries
- Wallet interfaces

## Rationale

The rationale section explains the design decisions:

### Design Choice 1

Why this particular approach was chosen over alternatives. Consider:
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Ease of implementation
- Backwards compatibility

### Design Choice 2

Additional design decisions and their justifications.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative A**: Why it was not chosen
- **Alternative B**: Pros and cons compared to the proposed solution
- **Status Quo**: Why the current implementation is insufficient

## Backwards Compatibility

This section describes any backwards compatibility concerns:

### Breaking Changes

List any breaking changes and their impact:
- Changes to block format
- Modified transaction validation
- Network protocol updates
- API deprecations

### Migration Path

Explain how existing systems can transition:
1. Upgrade procedure
2. Compatibility mode (if applicable)
3. Timeline for deprecation
4. Tools to assist migration

### Mitigation Strategies

How to minimize disruption:
- Gradual rollout
- Feature flags
- Deprecation warnings
- Documentation updates

## Test Cases

Example test cases that validate the implementation:

### Test Case 1: Basic Functionality

```rust
#[test]
fn test_example_feature() {
    // Setup
    let input = create_test_input();
    
    // Execute
    let result = example_function(input);
    
    // Verify
    assert_eq!(result.status, ExpectedStatus::Success);
}
```

### Test Case 2: Edge Cases

Description of edge cases and how they should be handled.

### Test Case 3: Error Conditions

Testing error handling and recovery.

## Implementation
